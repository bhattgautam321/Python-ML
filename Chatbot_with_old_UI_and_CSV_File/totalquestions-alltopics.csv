There are 'probots', which process data, 'knowbots' to gather and store data, and 'chatbots' which act as virtual agents to respond to customer queries in real time"

What does the RPA acronym mean?,"The RPA  acronym stands for Robotics Process Automation. RPA and its robots (or bots) is a technology that can be configured to ?observe? the way a trained user performs a particular task and the various decision points involved in accomplishing that task. RPA systems are generally based on artificial intelligence (AI). An RPA system watches the user perform a task in the application's graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This simplifies the programming of the system and increases productivity while lowering cost."

How will you approach when a project needs to implement devops?,"Stage 1: For any DevOps implementation an assessment of the existing process and implementation for around 2 to 3 weeks taking an average of 5 applications is a must to gauge the AS-IS process, identifies the improvement areas and provides a roadmap for the implementation.Typically a senior profile like a DevOps architect should be involved to conduct this assessment. Stage 2: A pilot POC can be done to showcase the end to end working of DevOps. Any pieces of training required will also need to be imparted to the process or tools. DevOps architects, engineers, and testers would need to be involved at this stage. Stage 3: The projects should now be in DevOps mode with all the components of continuous integration/delivery/testing and monitoring that is being followed."

Why is there a need for DevOps or why does DevOps matter?,"While the Developer community performs software development which is all about coding; writing the code, implementing, testing and re-writing the code, operations team looks after the systems that run that code. They work on things like how much processing power the software will need to run, how to make the software secure, how to make it run efficiently and how to keep it running. DevOps is needed when these two teams work for the same system. DevOps helps these developer and operations communities to learn how to work in a new way that facilitates the complete cooperation with each other.

Why is there a need for DevOps or why does DevOps matter,"While the Developer community performs software development which is all about coding; writing the code, implementing, testing and re-writing the code, operations team looks after the systems that run that code. They work on things like how much processing power the software will need to run, how to make the software secure, how to make it run efficiently and how to keep it running. DevOps is needed when these two teams work for the same system. DevOps helps these developer and operations communities to learn how to work in a new way that facilitates the complete cooperation with each other. DevOps provide a way for operations and development people with common methodologies and processes to work together in a mutual cooperation."

How DevOps increase system security in an organization,"DevOps maximize communications and thereby maximizes team's visibility into the software lifecycle. This enables the team to identify security flaws and errors before the code is released into production. DevOps maximize task automation in product development which drives consistency, predictability, resulting in lesser human errors during a manual process which otherwise could impede security. DevOps enable faster development and software delivery, which means faster debugging and fixing of security bugs. DevOps enable utilization of DevOps helps in adopting any tool that is more secure and reliable according to the software lifecycle processes without the need to be locked into outdated and non-secure tools and frameworks. DevOps favors agile development with Microservices and Containers, which help in isolating and securing applications from external attacks, human errors."

It aims to bring operations and development together, ensuring security during all the stages of the development process.sIt tries to automate the core security tasks by incorporating security controls and processes early in the DevOps workflow rather than attaching it in the end. DevSecOps brings automation from the start of the development cycle and thus, reduces the chances of misadministration and mistakes, which may lead to downtime or attacks. Automation also reduces manual configuration of security consoles."
